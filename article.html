Today we'd like to share a simple reveal animation with you that is mainly inspired by <a href="https://dribbble.com/Zhenya_Artem">Zhenya Rynzhuk's</a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4132057-Selected-Works-Transitions-Experiments">transition</a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4122652-Gallery-Page-Transition">experiments</a> and <a href="https://dribbble.com/gilhuybrecht">Gil Huybrecht's</a> <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/4142902-Boardathon">"Boardathon" Dribbble shot</a>. 

<div class="ct-featured-img-rss"><a href="http://tympanus.net/Development/SliceRevealer/"><img src="https://tympanus.net/codrops/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/SliceReveal.jpg" alt="SliceReveal" width="800" height="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-33927" /></a></div>

The idea is to cover and uncover an image with slices to either hide or show it. The slices can be vertical or horizontal and can come from different directions. Playing with the number of slices, delays and colors, creates a plethora of possible looks for this effect.

We are using <a href="http://animejs.com/">anime.js</a> for the animations and in the third demo we are making use of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API">Intersection Observer API</a> for triggering the effects on scroll.
